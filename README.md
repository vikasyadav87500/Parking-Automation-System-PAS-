                               Ever struggled to find parking space at your favorite mall? 

                                Ever had your vehicle damaged, tampered with, or stolen?

Many residential society administrations, tolls, business complexes and parking spaces in India lack an automated system for car parking and vehicle monitoring and face an impending problem of illegal car/vehicle parking inside their premises and other security concerns. The need of the hour is to devise a working and affordable model, wherein, when a vehicle passes through a check post the model identifies as many features of the vehicle as possible. With a smart amalgamation of offline and online technologies, the team must make the vehicle parking experience smooth and safe for everyone, while ensuring vehicle security and integrity alongside ethical monetization of the parking.
